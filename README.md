### The Song of Long Ago
to start with, asks a question...
can I make a playable, narrative-driven adventure game with ReactJs?

> With:
> * Music and sound effects
> * Consistent, simplistic art style
> * Animation / Movement controls that are smooth
> * Ability to save progress
> * Can be played in the browser

If not, can I still do it with JavaScript?
If not, I will at least have tried, and able to report my reasons here.
